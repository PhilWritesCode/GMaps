This code is still very much an experiment, and is not production ready.  It needs to be broken into
modules, and needs to be thoroughly tested.

I wish Ihad written this in a more test-driven way, but it was my way of learning Angular, 
so most of this was a "hack and see what happens" sort of thing.
